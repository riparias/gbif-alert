# Current

- The project was renamed from `pterois` to `gbif-alert`
- A proper git tag name is shown as the version number in footer (if available, otherwise the commit hash is used as it was before)
- Better response if a user tries to see the details of someone else's alert (https://github.com/riparias/gbif-alert/issues/223)
- Infra: we now provide a Docker / Docker Compose setup for easier deployment

# v1.0.0  (2023-07-12)

- First release as a reusable engine
